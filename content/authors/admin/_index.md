I'm currently studying master's in Quantum Science & Technology at TUM. This summer I'm joining IBM Quantum US as quantum software developer intern.<br>

I've been to quite some places, mostly for academic, research & software dev work. I've been working in Japan (Tokyo & Yokohama), Indonesia (Bandung & Jakarta), Germany (Munich), and Okinawa Japan & Switzerland (Geneva) if not for COVID :(<br>
Now I'm adding USA to the list :)

Eraraya Ricardo Muten (Edo) is an engineering physics undergraduate from Bandung Institute of Technology that has recently defended his thesis on quantum machine learning. He got to know quantum computing just about a year ago, but he catches up fast. He is the first Qiskit Advocate from his country (Indonesia) and currently leads the Indonesian Qiskit Docs translation team.
